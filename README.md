# afterparty-playlist-poll
A very simple php &amp; sqlite script to easily start a poll for generating a youtube playlist for your afterparty.

I've created most of this back in 2008 while I was on my way to an after party.
So the code is dirty and not tested well. Still does its job, and can be used for such small occasions.

People can add their favourite music videos to the list or vote for the existing ones.

    Just download it, place it in a php enabled setting and you are ready to go.
